            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Kushagra Tripathi, a first-year B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering (with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur.<br>

                I completed my schooling at St. Joseph's College, Prayagraj, where I first discovered my passion for technology. Since then, I've been building my skills in programming languages like Java, C, C++, Python, as well as web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
                
                I'm curious by nature and always excited to learn new thingsâ€”especially anything related to computers and AI. I speak English, Hindi, and a little bit of French, and I enjoy working in diverse teams and environments.<br>
                
                Outside the world of code, you'll probably find me playing cricket or exploring something new and interesting!<br>
                
                I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow, collaborate, and learn moreâ€”so feel free to connect!<br></p>

                <h3>â€¢ Laser Home Security System (Semiconductor Lab Project)</h3>
                Hardware-based model using laser and sensors
                Designed a simple laser-based home security system that triggers an alert when the laser beam is interrupted. This project helped me understand the practical applications of semiconductor components and sensors in real-world security systems.
                
                <h3>â€¢ Number Guessing Game</h3>
                Java & C
                Developed two versions of a classic number guessing gameâ€”one in Java with a user-friendly interface and another in C using console input. Improved my logic-building skills and learned the basics of random number generation and control structures.
                
                <h3>â€¢ Digital Timer</h3>
                C & Java
                Created a basic timer that allows users to set countdowns and view elapsed time. Practiced working with loops, time functions, and user input handling in both languages.
                
                <h3>â€¢ Digital Clock</h3>
                Java
                Built a functional digital clock application in Java using Swing. Displays real-time hours, minutes, and seconds with a clean interface. This project strengthened my understanding of Java GUI components and multi-threading.
